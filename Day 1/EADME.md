# ðŸš€ Exciting Journey with Verilog HDL! ðŸŽ‰âœ¨

Iâ€™m excited to dive into the fascinating world of Verilog HDL! With tools like **Model Sim** & **EDA Playground** in hand, Iâ€™ve taken my first steps into digital design and simulation. ðŸ’»âš¡

# Day 1 Highlights:
Here I'm designing and simulating 7 fundamental logic gates i.e. AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR.

This is just the beginning, and Iâ€™m eager to explore more complex circuits and simulations. Letâ€™s connect, collaborate, and grow together in this exciting field! ðŸ’¡âœ¨

Code is found in this folder and here is the ModelSim simulation results
